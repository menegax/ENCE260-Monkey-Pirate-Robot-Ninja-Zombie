//Instructions
Monkey-Robtot-Pirate-Ninja-Zombie is a fun variant of paper scissors rock.
On initilisation a smiley face will be on the LED matrix. Pressing the button
will move to the title screen, and pressing the button again will allow
you to choose a player. There cannot be two player 1s or the IR transfer
will not work! Pressing the navstick will choose your player. Then the four navstick
directions as well as the navstick push controls which action to throw, this is 
sent to the other controller when you press the button. Once the W/L/D is 
displayed, pressing the button again takes the game back to the choose action
phase.
